File Purpose: A couple proofs with recursive functions in C++.

This program was originally written as an in-class Computer Science assignment but cleaned up for publishing on GitHub.

Basically, anyone is free to check out, fork with improvements, use as a demonstration in classrooms, reference for Homework, etc.
Just as long as I'm quoted as writing this initial code. If there are any improvements and a pull request is asked for, I'll be sure to add your changes and quote who made the changes in the changelog.
